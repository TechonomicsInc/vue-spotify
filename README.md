# label

> A Vue.js project

This app uses a hard coded list of comma separated Spotify album ID's. It then pulls in the data via the Spotify Web API and adds it to the dom.

The reason i created this was i wanted to publish a list of the albums i have published as part of a record label i've been running on and off for some time.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# run unit tests
